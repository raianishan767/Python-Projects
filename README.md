# Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of 10 beginner-friendly Python projects. Each script focuses on applying basic programming concepts such as loops, functions, conditionals, file handling, and user input. These projects are simple, self-contained, and great for practicing core Python skills.

## Projects Included

Here’s a brief overview of what each project does:

- **atm_machine_simulation.py** – A basic ATM simulation that allows users to withdraw, deposit, and check their balance.
- **comtact_file.py** – A contact manager using file handling to store and retrieve contact information.
- **guess_the_word.py** – A simple game where the user has to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.
- **hotel_management.py** – Simulates a hotel booking and billing system, handling room selection and charges.
- **logic_gatw_simulator.py** – A logic gate simulator that mimics AND, OR, and NOT operations using Python conditionals.
- **rent_calculator.py** – Calculates rent based on the number of days and daily rate, with simple input and output.
- **rock_paper_scissor_game.py** – A command-line rock-paper-scissors game where the user plays against the computer.
- **to_do_list.py** – A basic to-do list application that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks.
- **virtual_zoo_simulator.py** – A zoo simulation that displays animal information and allows menu-based interaction.
- **voting_system.py** – Lets users vote for candidates and shows the results after voting ends.

## How to Run

You can run any of the Python files using the following command:


For example:


No additional setup is required.

## What You'll Learn

These projects demonstrate how to work with:

- Variables and data types
- If-else conditions
- Loops (`for` and `while`)
- Functions
- Lists and dictionaries
- File input/output
- Basic user input handling
- Random number generation (in some games)

## Requirements

All projects are built using standard Python libraries, so no external packages are needed. Just make sure you’re using **Python 3.x**.
